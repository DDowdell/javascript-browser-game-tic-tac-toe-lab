<!-- There is an <h2> element provided where you can display messages to the user. 
    It has an id of "message".
A game board has also been created inside of the <section> element. 
    It has a "board" class.
The game board is made up of nine <div> elements. 
    These elements all share the same class: 
    sqr, and also have unique ids ranging from 0 to 8.
 Think about why these might be numbered starting from 0 instead of 1. 
What data type have we used that starts from 0 instead of 1? 
This will come into play later.

Using id and/or class attributes will help you target elements 
for styling and wiring up your click event listeners.
These have already been added for you in this lab! -->
